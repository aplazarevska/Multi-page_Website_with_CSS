            <p>Deftones is an <em>American alternative metal band</em> formed in Sacramento, California in 1988.</p>
            <p>It was formed by <b>Chino Moreno</b>, <b>Stephen Carpenter</b>, <b>Abe Cunningham</b>, and <b>Dominic Garcia</b>. During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, <b>Chi Cheng</b> was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist <b>Frank Delgado</b> being added in 1999.</p>
            <p>The band is known as one of the most experimental groups to have come from the alternative metal scene, and are sometimes dubbed by critics as <em>"the Radiohead of metal"</em>.</p>
            <p>Although initially rooted in metal, Deftones have always claimed diverse influences from groups of various genres, with their musical style diversifying over their career. Their sound has been described as <em>alternative metal, art rock/art metal, experimental rock, nu metal, post-punk, post-hardcore, dream pop, drone rock, post-metal, shoegazing, post-rock, stoner rock, trip hop, glitch, math metal, psychedelia,</em> and <em>funk metal</em>.</p>
            <p>In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled Eros, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on Eros.</p>
            <p>Deftones have released <em>nine albums</em> since their inception.</p>
