# Band Tribute Website with CSS

My first CSS challenge, taking the previous website I did with HTML and adding CSS style to it.

## Description

For this task, I had to link CSS stylesheet to my HTML file I made previously for my Multi-page website challenge. 

I had to choose two Google fonts (one for headings, one for everything else).

Then I was required to set font colours, background colours and background images where appropriate. I had to use the width and height properties for some images, adjust some font-size, adjust the opacity of the background-image, keep footer at the bottom, use copyright symbol, and use pseudo-classes on the links in the Navbar.
